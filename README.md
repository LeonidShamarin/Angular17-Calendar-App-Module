## Working with Dates and Times

This application uses the JavaScript `Date` object to handle all date and time operations. Here are some examples of how the `Date` object is used:

- To create a new date:
    ```javascript
    const date = new Date();
    ```

- To set a specific date and time:
    ```javascript
    const date = new Date('2024-06-15T09:00:00');
    ```

- To format a date:
    ```javascript
    const formattedDate = date.toLocaleDateString();
    const formattedTime = date.toLocaleTimeString();
    ```
